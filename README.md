Trello Bootstra
(A fork of the excellent Trello2HTML)
===

A handy tool for printing Trello boards in a nice way.

Based on the excellnt "Trello2HTML" (https://github.com/tianshuo/Trello)

NOTES:

This needs to run via a hosted instance (e.g. not by just opening the HTML file). If you have python installed, this is easy, just CD into the directory with your code and do this:

'''
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
'''
